-Design 
1. I have created with a format that is meant to be responsive friendly. There will be a container, followed by a header section and the card sections.  The css will be targeted into this 3 different components and the idea is to only try to reuse as much classes as possible.
2. For the header component, i had try to divide the whole header into 3 cols to adjust accordingly.
